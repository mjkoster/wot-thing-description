<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Thing Description information model is a core set of definitions for terms defined in [[!WOT-ARCHITECTURE]]. These definitions take the form of a vocabulary embedded in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). An overview of this vocabulary with its class context and class relation is given by the following three figures: TD core model, TD data schema model, and TD security model.</p>

    <h2>Security Vocabulary Definition</h2>

<p class="ednote" title="Security Metadata Sources">
The set of security metadata supported by the core TD vocabulary is still under discussion.  
For the core vocabulary the focus is on well-established security  
mechanisms, such as those built into protocols supported by WoT  
or already in wide use with those protocols.  
Note that the vocabulary extension mechanism of the WoT Thing Description allows for additional security schemes if needed.  
The current set of security schemes is partly based on <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#securitySchemeObject">OpenAPI 3.0.1</a>.  
The security schemes, vocabulary and syntax given in this specification share many similarities with OpenAPI; however, it is not fully compatible.  
Also, as OpenAPI targets only web services built around HTTP it does not cover the full set of use cases required for the IoT.  
Therefore, we are currently discussing metadata supporting additional security mechanisms for IoT-centered protocols such as CoAP and MQTT.  

For more information about what security schemes are under discussion (and to file issues if you have a request) please visit the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-security">WoT Security TF repository.</a>
